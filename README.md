# ðŸ“¦ Sustainability Reporting: Scope 3 Emissions from Transportation

## Supply Chain Sustainability Report with Python

This project analyses Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions resulting from third-party logistics operations across customer orders. It employs a weight-based emissions quantification method to derive insights that inform more sustainable supply chain decisions.



## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Quantify and analyse COâ‚‚ emissions associated with transportation in the value chain.
- **Data Source:** Customer order dataset (5,200+ records) with delivery modes, product weights, and shipment distances.
- **Outcome:** Evaluate emissions distribution, identify reduction opportunities, and simulate future sustainability scenarios using Power BI.



## Key Features

- **Scope 3 Emissions Estimation:**
  - Applied DEFRA-based emission factors to estimate COâ‚‚ per order.
  - Considered multiple delivery modes (road, rail, air, etc.).

- **Data Aggregation and Analysis:**
  - Grouped and aggregated order-level emissions data.
  - Mapped customer locations and city clusters.

- **Sustainability Scenario Modelling:**
  - Evaluated the impact of switching delivery modes.
  - Estimated profitability and emission trade-offs city-wise.
